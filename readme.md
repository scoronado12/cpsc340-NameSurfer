# NameSurfer

Against all bureaucratic stereotypes, the Social Security Administration provides a neat web site showing the distribution of names chosen for children over the last 100 years in the United States (http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/). The Social Security Administration provides data that shows the 1000 most popular boy and girl names for children at 10 year intervals. 

This program parses a given textfile formatted with data looking like this.

    Sam 58 69 99 131 168 236 278 380 467 408 466 997
    Samantha 0 0 0 0 0 0 272 107 26 5 7 63
    Samara 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 886 0

I wrote this during my time as an undergraduate. If the professor who graded this is still teaching Data Structures, there is a chance that you may have gotten this exact assignment. Please understand that use of any piece of this code and passing it off as your own solution consitutes an honor code violation and I will not be made responsible by anyone in any way for your foolishness in not listening to me.
