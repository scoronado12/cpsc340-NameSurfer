# NameSurfer

Against all bureaucratic stereotypes, the Social Security Administration provides a neat web site showing the distribution of names chosen for children over the last 100 years in the United States (http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/). The Social Security Administration provides data that shows the 1000 most popular boy and girl names for children at 10 year intervals. 

This program parses a given textfile formatted with data looking like this.
